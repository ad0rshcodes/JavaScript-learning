// Interestingly ðŸ¤” JavaScript behaves bit differently. For ex:

//Try:1 =>
sayHello();

function sayHello() {
  console.log("hii");
}
// This works bcoz the global context hoist all the functions at the beginning of the file.

// Try:2 =>
console.log(sayHello("how are you doing?", "Adarsh"));

const sayHello = function (message, sender) {
  return `Hii my name is ${sender} and ${message}`;
};
// This trial doesn't work because global context doesn't hoist varibales in the beginning of file & here the function is in the form of variable.

//Global Context
var myName = "adarsh";

if (myName === myName) {
  //this works fine âœ” in both browser and vs code
  console.log("Bazinga!!");
}

if (myName === window.myName) {
  //this works fine âœ” in browser but not in vs code as we are execcuting it in node. The "window" keyword refers to the global context and is differnt for node.
  console.log("Bazinga!!");
}
